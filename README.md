# Box-O-Noodles
A mockup of a subscription box website. Created to practice bootstrap and sass specifically. 

Utilizing SCSS, Bootstrap, and HTML I have created a simple mockup webpage for a fake subscription box service. The values used in the "products" aren't to be taken seriously. 

The mini project is intended to showcase the skills used and thus, buttons and links are static.
